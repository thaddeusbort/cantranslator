The CAN translation module code runs on an Arduino-compatible microcontroller
connected to one or more CAN buses. It receives either all CAN messages or a
filtered subset, performs any unit conversion or factoring required and outputs
a generic version to a USB interface.

For more documentation, see the `vehicle interface`_ section on the `OpenXC
website`_ or the `CAN translator documentation`_.
