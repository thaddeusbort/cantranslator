About
=====

The CAN translation module code runs on an Arduino-compatible microcontroller
connected to one or more CAN buses. It receives either all CAN messages or a
filtered subset, performs any unit conversion or factoring required and outputs
a generic version to a USB interface.

Pre-built Binary
================

If you've downloaded a pre-built binary for a specific vehicle, see the
:doc:`/installation/binary` section for instructions on how to flash your CAN
translator. Most users do not need to set up the full development described in
these docs.

A Windows driver for the USB interface is available in the `conf/windows-driver
<https://github.com/openxc/cantranslator/tree/master/conf/windows-driver>`_
folder. The driver supports both 32- and 64-bit Windows. The driver is generated
using the `libusb-win32 <http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/libusb-win32/wiki>`_
project.

Python Library
----------------------

The `OpenXC Python library`_, in particular the `openxc-dashboard` tool, is
useful for testing the CAN translator with a regular computer, to verify the
data received from a vehicle before introducing an Android device. Documentation
for this tool (and the list of required dependencies) is available on the OpenXC
`vehicle interface testing`_ page.

Android Library
----------------------

The `OpenXC Android library`_ is the primary entry point for new OpenXC
developers. More information on this library is available at in the
`applications`_ section of the `OpenXC website`_.
