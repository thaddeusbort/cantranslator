# OpenXC CAN Translator Changelog

## v3.2

* Support building to run under a USB bootloader on the LPC17xx.
* Bug fix: custom value handlers are now called every time a signal is received,
  regardless of the value of `send_same` and `send_frequency`.

## v3.1

* Minor improvements to bootstrap scripts for greater compatibility.
* Add LED indicator module and some feedback when I/O interfaces are active.
  * (PIC32) Flash user LED on chipKIT when CAN is active.
  * (LPC17xx) Control 2 RGB LEDs based on CAN activity and I/O interface
    activity.
* Add microcontroller power control to enable sleeping when CAN is active.
  * (LPC17xx) Put the micro into low power mode when CAN is quiet, wake with CAN
    activity. Turn off Bluetooth module on Ford prototype board, 12v power
    passthrough and all other peripherals.
* Monitor VBUS of micro-USB port to improve performance when USB is disconnected
  * (PIC32) If micro-USB VBUS is patched into analog input 0 on the chipKIT,
    read true USB status from that pin.
  * (LPC17xx) Read VBUS status from LPC17xx VBUS input.
* Pull C queue implementation out to an independent library,
  [emqueue](https://github.com/openxc/emqueue).

## v3.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: Combine `odometer` and `fine_odometer_since` restart into a
  single high-precision signal, `odometer`. There is no more
  fine_odometer_since_restart signal.
* BREAKING CHANGE: `decodeCanMessage` in signals.h now is pass the `CanBus` the
  message was received on; signals.cpp files will need to be updated.
* PIC32: UART output at high baud rates (i.e. above 115200).
* PIC32: Detect if USB is actually attached to avoid wasting time - speeds up
  UART dramatically if micro-USB 5v line connected to Analog Input 0 instead of
  5v port on chipKIT Network Shield.
* Slow down emulator to better match a real vehicle's throughput.
* For mappings with "ignore" flag, code generator for signals.cpp will set
  signals handlers to `ignoreHandler` instead of skipping entirely.
* CAN messages with identical IDs can now exist on both CAN1 and CAN2.

## v2.1.3

* Remove custom protocol for "binary" transfers - use "passthrough" JSON style.
* Fix a NULL pointer dereference in the button handler that caused hard crashes
  when CAN2 was connected.
* Calculate correct value for rolling fuel consumed value, it incremented too
  fast previously in some vehicles.

## v2.1.2

* Use bootstrap script when flashing binary firmware.
* Refactor some custom message handlers
* Avoid using cJSON in API for test suite

## v2.1.1

* Add bootstrap script to help new developers set up the build environment.
* Add support for building from source in Windows (with Cygwin)
* Support scripts in root directory are not moved to `script` subdirectory
* JSON mapping format now expects message ID in hex (e.g. "0x80") instead of
  decimal.

## v2.1

* Add Ethernet support on the chipKIT (thanks Ewgenij!)

## v2.0

* Further refactoring to support an additional platform, the ARM Cortex M3
  (specifically the LPC1768/69), with the same code base.
* Fix CAN bus freeze up issue and remove workaround.
* Re-organize build process to improve performance when compiling.
* Remove reader.py testing script, which was extracted into the openxc-python
  library.

## v1.3

* Major refactoring of library internals for better portability.
* Support sending OpenXC messages over UART in addition to USB.
* Add experimental CAN message writing support.

## v1.2

* Add a unit test suite, compiled and run on the development computer.
* Many, many bug fixes.
* Workaround a CAN bus freeze up on the chipKIT by detecting the freeze and
  restarting the CAN connection.

## v1.1

* Add custom handler infrastructure for messages and signals
* Refactor CAN internals

## v0.9
* Pre-release version for testing, supports chipKIT
